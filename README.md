## 📝 Evaluation Summary

NotebookLM worked well for reviewing lecture material. The AI answered questions directly from the uploaded PDF without pulling in unrelated information. It was especially helpful for summarising key ideas and creating self-study prompts. However, I would still double-check important facts before using the content in an assignment.

NotebookLM is a helpful tool for revision, but it should be used with caution for academic writing or referencing.
